### Quick Notes

Files to build a Docker container that will retrieva data from Kasa smart plugs using the open source "unofficial" Kasa Python Library. This version of the container transmits the data via MQTT, while I primarily use the version that writes data directly to InfluxDB this version exists for collecting the data on a low powered device where MQTT might be a smarter approach than using a REST API.
