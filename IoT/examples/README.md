### Sensor Examples

Basic examples of how to connect to various types of sensors and IoT smart devices, e.g., air quality, barometric pressure, CO2, humidity, smart plugs, etc. Unlike the containerized versions in this folder's parent that publish data to an MQTT broker, write to InfluxDB and/or require data ingestion infrastructure, the code in this folder are stand-alone examples for connecting to the sensor and then pushing the data to console to validate that the sensor + device combination works.
