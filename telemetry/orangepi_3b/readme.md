Containerized python script(s) retrieving telemetry data from an Orange Pi 3B I'm using to run Air Quality sensors. I thought about using endpoints that could be scraped, but this solution w/ MQTT seems like it would use less energy. Plus, I like the idea of decentralized telemetry: there isn't a single service that gathers data from each device, instead each device sends its own data via MQTT and that opens up future opportunities for two-way communications in response to a particular HW status.
