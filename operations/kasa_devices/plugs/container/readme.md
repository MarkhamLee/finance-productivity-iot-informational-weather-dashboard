### Quick Notes
* main.py and kasa_power_plug.py are nearly identical, the former is for the Docker container and the later is for stand-alone use. The only difference is that main.py gets all key variables (ports, broker ip, topic, device IP, etc) from environmental variables, while the latter gets topic, refresh interval and device IP via command line parameters.
