### Short Overview

This folder contains Kubernetes deployment manifests contains deployment manifests for applications I found difficult to setup, or are critical to a degree that they're worth calling out. E.g., Airflow and Zigbee2MQTT can both be a pain, but InfluxDB is fairly simple. The rest of the applications relevant to this project can be found in the repo for the [Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/MarkhamLee/kubernetes-k3s-data-and-IoT-platform) this project runs on.
