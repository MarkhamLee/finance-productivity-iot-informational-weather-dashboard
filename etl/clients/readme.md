#### Connection Clients

Putting the "standard python" versions of the various clients for things like PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, etc., here, as due to the nature of Airflow DAGs it stands to reason that even though the plugins start out as typical Python clients, they will probably shift over time and may not be useful for ETL pipelines outside of Airflow.
