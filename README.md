# Productivity, Home IoT, Music, Stocks & Weather Dashboard

The primary purrpose of this project is to see if I can improve my productivity by putting information I usually get from my phone, forget to monitor, etc., into one place for easy access. I.e. if I can just glance at a browswer tab (or two) or my iPad to get everything I need, it should reduce the amount of time I spend on my phone. 


**Current plans:**
* External data will be largely ingested via Airflow
* Home IoT sensors (temperature/climate, soil moisture for plants) will be ingested via MQTT to Node-Red 


**Targeted Sources:**
* Asana (where I keep my to do lists)
* Air Quality & Weather via the OpenWeather API [DONE]
* Finance tracking the S&P 500, T-Bills and maybe 1-2 other stocks 
* Discord - I belong to some great servers that I don't monitor enough 
* Spotify - alerts for podcast updates
