Containerized python script(s) for retrieving telemetry data (temps, cpu load, RAM utilziation, etc) from single board computers (SBCs) and other small devices that would primarily be used for gathering data from sensors for air quality, temperature, soil moisture and other types of sensors. These devices would be deployed as remote sensing stations that are independent or are nodes within a Kubernetes clsuter. In the Kubernetes use case the primary reason for using these containers would be to monitor CPU and disk temps, as the k8s monitoring solutions don't monitor device temps, just utilization metrics like RAM, Storage and CPU.
